# Google Code Jam 2019
These are my messy solutions for
[Google Code Jam 2019](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/schedule)
in **Python 3**. Will only update after each round so no cheating :)

The solutions, unless indicated, passed all tests. Some folders include
"solution-submit.py", which is the solution that I submitted to the judge and,
if present, had passed all test cases. The reason for a new "solution.py" can
be one of many, as they might contain some performance boosts, or just that
the one submitted does not meet my aesthetic standards. "solution-noveri.py"
was not verified, for various reasons (obviously I did *not* overslept and
missed a round). However, they are guaranteed to pass the limited test cases
that are available as example.

## Why Python 3?
It's good enough; it runs fast enough; I'm lazy; it has much handled for me.
(Though I still find myself uncontrollably typing ;'s after every statement)
